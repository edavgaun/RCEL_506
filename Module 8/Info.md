# Possum dataset
This classic practice regression dataset comes originally from the DAAG R package (datasets used in examples and exercises in the book Maindonald, J.H. and Braun, W.J. (2003, 2007, 2010) "Data Analysis and Graphics Using R"). This dataset is also used in the OpenIntro Statistics book chapter 8 Introduction to linear regression.
