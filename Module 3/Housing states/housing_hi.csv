Other things leave me, but it abides; other things change, but it remains the same. For me the balmy airs are always blowing, its summer seas flashing in the sun; the pulsing of its surfbeat is in my ear; I can see its garlanded crags, its leaping cascades, its plumy palms drowsing by the shore, its remote summits floating like islands above the cloud wrack; I can feel the spirit of its wildland solitudes, I can hear the splash of its brooks; in my nostrils still lives the breath of flowers that perished twenty years ago.""

Other things leave me, but it abides; other things change, but it remains the same. For me the balmy airs are always blowing, its summer seas flashing in the sun; the pulsing of its surfbeat is in my ear; I can see its garlanded crags, its leaping cascades, its plumy palms drowsing by the shore, its remote summits floating like islands above the cloud wrack; I can feel the spirit of its wildland solitudes, I can hear the splash of its brooks; in my nostrils still lives the breath of flowers that perished twenty years ago.""

I am a 32yr old F looking for a roommate for the second bedroom in the condo I am currently RENTING that is fully furnished. Lease starts in 2/1/2020.

This will be a MONTH TO MONTH lease with minimum 30 day notice on both ends for ending lease. Must provide security deposit and first months rent upon move in. You will have your own room and bathroom with shared shower. This is a newly remodeled unit that is very well kept.

My life is focused on health and wellness. Working out, meal prepping, hiking, beach days and outings with the girls are how I prefer to spend my free time. I like to keep a VERY CLEAN home but as far as everything else goes I'm pretty laid back. I also have a video tour of the room but CL will not let me post.  **If you are a messy person or someone who hates to clean this is NOT the place for you!!!
