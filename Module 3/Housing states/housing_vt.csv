I have lived here for 3 years while remodeling it- it's in an amazing location. I am open to having some pets, but each pet is a $35/mo pet fee for the accelerated wear on the recently refinished hardwood floors. If you want the apartment furnished, it is a $100/mo option.  Lease price of 1390 is for a 12 month lease. If you want a 6-10 month lease, the price goes up by $50. For 2-6 month leases, the price goes up $100 since then it's similar to a airbnb and I will have a lot of turnover and risk of having vacant months.  This house is awesome- very quiet part of the neighborhood. You'd be surprised how quiet- no college kids up this end of the street. Housemates downstairs are super friendly, young working professionals. I am including a small laundry setup for this house but it is meant for 1 person and it hooks up to the sink. It has a fenced in yard, 3 car garage (renting a dedicated garage bay to yourself is $40/mo, with EV charging), hose for washing cars/bikes. Screened in porch with bench, lights, hammock (my favorite room). Another porch that isn't screened in that I use for storage.  After the house had $5K worth of insulation added, I had a heat pump installed which keeps your apartment comfy during summer and winter! This unit does your heat during the winter, and you have central A/C during the summer. Average electric bill is $40-50 with proof- and this is your only bill other than internet! Bedroom and living room are very large. Bathroom is not huge, but pretty and recently remodeled. Shower large enough for two people! I just finished the kitchen remodel, including all new stainless appliances, cabinets, backsplash, paint!   PLEASE include some information about yourself and who would be living with you (including pets).  Thank you, Andrew R Owner @ VT Sustainable Real Estate, LLC",44.4872,-73.2065,vt
