The complex is pet friendly, centrally-located, and very quiet. There is a community space with billiards, a computer lab, fitness center, and movie theater. There are plenty of socialization opportunities that property management puts on, but if youâre not interested, you donât have to participate. The complex recently added a dog park area and is in the process of building a hot tub area.  The complex has a large parking lot with free parking for residents and some reserved parking available also. Personally, I have found it to be very easy to find parking close to the buildings.  The apartment is a 4 bedroom unit on the first floor with the room being a private bedroom and bathroom. The apartment has a full kitchen, washer/dryer in unit, fully furnished, plus it has a spacious living room with a large flat-screen television. The bedroom is private, and lockable, with a private bathroom, extra closet space, and is fully furnished. The complex is dog/cat/bird friendly. Also, utilities are built into the cost of rent.  While the bedroom/bathroom is private, there are three other roommates that you share the community space with (living room, laundry, and kitchen). All three are very quiet, respectful, friendly, and they all LOVE animals. All typically stay in their own spaces. The roommates are a student and two young professionals. One roommate has a very sweet puppy. Another has a service/emotional support dog. Both dogs are fairly quiet and respectful of the community spaces. With roommate approval, you could bring your pet for an extra pet rent of $25/month.  The lease is through July 31, 2020, ideal for a last semester senior or a young professional. The lease is individualized to you, so you donât have to worry about anyone except for yourself. There is an option to renew the lease at the end of the term if you decide youâd like to stay. Also, you donât have to be a student to live here!  I will be moving out by the end of December 2019, so Iâm super flexible about a move in date.

Architecturally unique, this open-concept, 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom home with an attached two-car garage is comfortable, contemporary, and is in the highly sought-after Baxter Meadows neighborhood.  The open first floor has spectacular views of the Bridger Mountains. It includes a modern, well-equipped kitchen - complete with polished concrete counter tops, and a wooden slab bar top. There is a dining area and a living room with a gas fireplace and vaulted ceilings. The home has beautiful natural light due to all of the double-hung windows. The ground floor also includes a furnished private office and a half bathroom. Outdoor amenities include a covered wrap-around porch in the front, and a covered furnished patio and BBQ in back.  The upstairs also features vaulted ceilings. The master suite includes a king-sized bed, a large walk-in closet, and a full bathroom with a shower/tub combination and two sinks. The other bedrooms are both comfortably furnished and have queen-sized beds. There is a second full bathroom. All bathrooms have modern fixtures and finishes. To top it off, there is a huge bonus room upstairs with a Foosball table!   The home is tastefully and comfortably furnished with many unique details. It has a full-sized washer and dryer, WiFi internet, natural wood double-hung windows, and natural wood trim and floors. Furnishings include ""top-down bottom-up"" cellular window blinds, carpeting upstairs, ceiling fans, custom lighting and natural tile. (A few of the furnishings may end up being slightly different than they appear in the photos, if we need to update anything at the end of the current lease.)  Some of the wonderful aspects of this great neighborhood are the many trails and parks. Open space borders the house property on two sides, giving it an expansive feel. It is only a half block away from a 10-acre neighborhood park with a creek, and is within easy walking distance to the regional 100-acre park. In between are interconnecting trails, great for running, or for biking downtown, to MSU and to many nearby amenities.   The home is conveniently located to shopping, Bridger Bowl, the Bozeman International Airport, I-90, and is less than an hour from Big Sky Resort.   Nearby schools include Emily Dickinson School - grades PK-5, Chief Joseph Middle School -grades 6-8 (a short walk away), and Bozeman High, grades 9-12.

We are looking for tenants/room mates in a nice, newer Baxter meadows house. My brother and I are 26 years old and live and work in Seattle, Washington and in the past have rented the whole house out. Now weâre thinking it would be nice to have the option to come home and have a place to stay once in a while. There are two large bedrooms and two smaller bedrooms. In a perfect world we would rent the two big ones and leave the two small bedrooms for my brother and I. Weâre laid back young guys and weâre looking for people who are easy going. Lease duration would be negotiable, weâre looking for some stability but understand the need for flexibility too. We would essentially be looking to rent until June but would be open to shorter options. If we moved back in for a more significant amount of time than a week or two we would also lower the rent to $600 a room. The house is nice, has brand new appliances that shouldnât give anyone any problems. We understand that this isnât as cut and dry as renting a full house with a normal lease but We are more than happy to answer any questions. Ideally, we find two people who come together but if we have to, we will rent the two rooms individually. Unfortunately, because we just put brand new solid hardwood floors in we have to say no dogs.  406-22four-222three",45.5781,-111.126,mt

Inside is well kept and has a great floor plan in that the living area is upstairs where you would usually only find the bedrooms.  This gives the living area good views.  Ideal separation to the floor plan as there are 2 bedrooms and a full bath upstairs with the kitchen and living area.  Then downstairs is a full bath, big bedroom and a family room.  Owner is offering a good winter time rate of $1350 (this unit is worth $1450 a month typically) plus offering flexible lease terms.  Initial lease can be just 6 months and then go month to month but not past Sept of 2020.  Or owner will lease for 18 months so the lease comes up in the summer instead of the winter.  This is ideal for anyone needing quality temporary housing who does not want a traditional one year lease.  Also, great for a quality tenant looking for really solid and nice long term housing. Well behaved dog will be considered.  Property marketed by a licensed real estate broker in Mt. Call KC Hart at 240-7000 to inquire and to see the property.  No application fees are charged.
