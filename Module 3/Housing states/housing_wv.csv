The rental is $2000 per month plus utilities. The tenants would be required to mow the small area of grass and keep the outside of the place up.

Real post from a real man seeking a partner. These are challenging times but why struggle alone? There's no shame in it really - life is not easy but there is better for all of us and that ""better"" is found in the choices we make now, not the ones we have already made. Everyone should want a clean slate and you can get that here. You see, I had a recurring dream over the course of 3 weeks that I would find the right partner for myself and my family through a housing post. As hokey as that sounds, it is precisely what I am doing. You would be pleasantly surprised to see and meet the man typing this post!  If you are single, divorced, separated or widowed, and you are tired of struggling, want to learn a business while taking care of a good guy and a family....here it is! I am seeking a nurturing Mom type who loves kids and would LOVE to be a house mouse and work part-time in our family business if you work at all. If you are taking care of family and home the right way, that alone is a full time job. It is the most important job there is. I run a successful and well known family business that I am looking to grow in the real estate/contracting/home repair arena. It is not a start-up and I have been in the business for over 20 years. I am direct, straight forward, attractive and looking to combine forces and lives with a partner who is tired of all the nonsense and is like-minded. If you have ever seen married at first sight - here's the live version just for you!  I am drowning trying to balance everything - just like you. Unlike you perhaps, I am well off and own a large home in a great east cobb lake community in the best school districts. I have a strong Faith and had a recurring dream for several weeks that I would find the love of my life from a housing ad so here I am. My friends and family think I am an idiot so help me prove them wrong! I need help with daily life and so do you. If you are starting over, this just might be the ticket. I know, it's the strangest job/housing post you have ever seen. Why try this, why not? I am a super busy single Dad with kids here half the time and a huge need for someone in my life to share the load with. I am in the best school district so if you have a child this can be totally win-win all the way around. If you love business, making money and helping people at the same time let's connect and see. Let's chat, meet and combine lives!  Home is a large executive estate home on a lake in a swim/tennis community in the Roswell/woodstock area and office is near Sprayberry. We are in an industry that never fails so if you want to learn to earn, you've come to the right place! I will respond to all. Me - I am attractive, well educated, passionate, in decent shape and a total family man who is surprisingly single. My being single honestly does not even make sense except that I spent the past 4 years coaching basketball year round plus running my business. I was engaged last year and she decided she wanted out because I am pro vaccination when it comes to kids and she was not. Stupid reason to break up but it is what it is! Two weeks later, she wanted to come back so go figure. I am slowly drowning with all that I am trying to do and need help in my life as well. The days of the lone wolf are over - we all need to partner with someone to just have a better life!  Love can come in all shapes, sizes and flavors. What I really need is an equal partner with a huge heart. A 1950's type who values family above all else and seeks financial security, protection and love in return for doing what she just loves to do anyway! I am not the least bit concerned with how bad your present situation may be - I am more interested in your goals and what you would like to do going forward. If you believe it, you can achieve it. I am a great cook known for 10-course holiday dinners that I cook from scratch. I would love a partner who loves to cook, maybe bake and is a little OCD about keeping a home.  So be brave, send me snide comments or toss stones at me but either way, you may just find someone incredible and amazing at the other end of this post! Let us at least chat, see how we connect and meet. Real guy - today is a warm Saturday in Atlanta",34.0408,-84.3859,wv
