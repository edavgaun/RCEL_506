As you walk into this available, spacious duplex, you'll notice the open floor plan with a large carpeted living room that flows into a nice sized, dining room and a widely spaced kitchen, both with linoleum flooring.  The kitchen already houses the standard appliances and has plenty of drawer and cabinet space.  As you walk through the kitchen, you'll come to a nice sized, secluded laundry room with washer/dryer hookups.  The two bedrooms, both located in the back of this duplex unit, are positioned on separate sides of the central connecting hallway.

The duplex unit's second bathroom, located off the central hallway, can be considered a guest bathroom, with the convenience of being full sized.  With this available duplex unit, you'll enjoy the convenience of a single car garage and automatic garage door.  Adding to the amenities is a nice sized wooden deck, central heat and air, and total electric.  This duplex is located in The Webb City School District, with the elementary, middle and high school buildings all within a mile away.
