Fully furnished, excepting bed and bath linens, this lovely and tastefully updated one-bedroom apartment is located in a peaceful and quiet neighborhood on Basin Road, the border between civilization and the wild. Immediately adjacent to the Last Chance Basin recreational area, you have direct access to the Mt. Roberts and Perseverance Trails, Gold Creek Flume, and Last Chance Mining Museum. State, Federal, and Legislative offices are all within walking distance, as are Downtown Juneau businesses and stores. City bus stops are just a few blocks down the hill.  As long as the sun is in the sky, the front of building has lots of direct light. The rear of the building, where the bedroom is located, is shaded and quiet because nothing but the mountain is behind the building. Coin-op commercial-sized washer and dryer are available in a separate secured area of the building. The apartment is spacious with lots of storage. While the 'front yard' area is small, outdoor gardens and pots with lots of flowers and color are pleasant and appealing. The apartment is furnished pretty much as portrayed in the posted photos. Most of the furniture and kitchenware was purchased new in mid-2018. The 'sofa' is a Eurobed and the dining table expands to seat up to six so you can accommodate dinner and weekend guests.  One dog on approval with an additional non-refundable pet deposit. Liability waiver signed by the owner is required. Dog must have up-to-date rabies vaccinations and a current or pending CBJ dog license. (Sorry - no feline friends. Allergic!)

Legislative staff and Juneau newcomers are most welcome!   NO indoor smoking (please!)    -  Monthly rent: $1450           includes ALL utilities (electricity, water/sewer, garbage) plus unlimited high-speed Wi-Fi           (January pro-rated basis)    -  Security deposit:  $1450                 fully refundable, provided all terms of lease agreement are met and there are no damages    -  Non-refundable pet deposit (if applicable):  $100    -  Signed rental application is required and references are checked (no charge)    -  Lease agreement is required. The initial term of the lease agreement is three months, allowing the      tenant more flexibility. After the initial three-month term, the lease automatically converts to       month-to-month tenancy.   Please respond to this Craigslist ad using their email relay system, and include your name and how you would me to contact you (phone, text, email, etc.) If you would like me to call you, please remember to include a good telephone number!

PLEASE do not disturb current tenants.  The pictures speak for themselves.  This home is right out of HGTV.  It has been immaculately updated with modern, high-end finishes.  It is located near Seward Meridian & the Palmer-Wasilla Highway, in Wasilla.  It officially has 3 bedrooms, but there could be a 4th room (the downstairs bonus room) which could act as a bedroom for small children.  Granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, large one-bowl stainless steel farmer's apron sink, bamboo hardwood flooring, huge back deck, large fenced yard, open concept, huge master on the main level, TWO bonus rooms, front-loading washer & dryer with a folding area in the utility/laundry room.  Two ceiling fans in Master Bdrm, and one in the main living room & upper bonus room.  The home is partly furnished including a leather sectional sofa, dining room set, nightstands, & end tables if you want them, or there is plenty of room to store those items if not.    This home has mountain views on three sides, and Wal-Mart is only 5 minutes away.   There's a 600-sq-ft, 3-room, attached but SEPARATE, office/shop/retail space with separate entrances at ground level for your small business.  It was formerly a 2-car tandem garage, but has been fully remodeled and presents as a professional office.  It would be suitable for an attorney, accountant, insurance or real estate agent, or any number of other professionals, as well as a retail store-front.  The office has high-end vinyl plank flooring and two entrances, front and rear, and there's room for 6-8 customer cars.  We are currently having a small powder room installed in the office also (which will be completed by January 5), with a toilet and sink.  It is a fully-self-contained office and can be used for all sorts of business activities.  With literally THOUSANDS of potential customers or clients driving by this house every day, (although it is on a parallel access road) the possibilities for any business are endless here!  You could even place a sign above the front office door, which is at street level.     There's a 2-3 horse capacity barn, tack room, and hay storage area which could once again be fenced with your horse fencing -- or it can be used for storage.  There's a large, grassy, fenced backyard for your dog.  There's a large, fenced-off garden plot ready for next season's vegetable planting.  Pets may be allowed on approval.  There is no garage (it's been converted into the office/shop), but there is plenty of parking, including RV parking, and a 50 amp outlet for an RV.  This home is not on the market for sale at the moment, but may be put on the market sometime in 2020.  Because it's a unique property with a commercial emphasis, it will take a unique buyer and is likely to be on the market for a long time.  What this means for you, is that while you may be asked to preapprove the occasional viewing or Open House, it will not be a constant thing.     If this house is put on the market, you will be asked to keep the house clean, to keep up the property inside & out, with lawn mowing, flower-watering, snow plowing, weed-whacking, etc., (in other words, to be responsible tenants as if this was your own home) and to reasonably pre-approve all viewings with a minimum 24-hour notice, or reasonably reschedule them to a more convenient time, and to be absent from the home with your pets(s) when the Buyer's Agent shows up.  Also, smoking will only be allowed outside the home, and cigarette butts need to be contained and discarded.  You may use the Office / Retail Space for your retail/wholesale/professional business or craft area, but NOT AS A STORAGE area, and NOT filled to the brim with boxes, etc., since area would be a primary selling feature of the home and needs to be showable as such.  In exchange, you will get to live in this 2,900 sq ft executive home (which would easily normally rent for $2,900 a month) for only $2,295 a month, plus utilities (gas, electric, and trash disposal).  The security deposit is $2,000.  The contract will be month-to-month, but as I mentioned, is likely to be a long-term rental.  If the house does sell, you will be given 45 days from the date the offer is accepted.    We might consider a Rent-To-Own or Lease-Option situation under the right circumstances, for up to 12 months ONLY, while you gather your down payment money, etc.  You must provide a preapproval letter from a lender for $365,950.  Please respond by calling me or preferably via an email letter including:   -- any questions you have   -- your names and dates of birth (so I can run a background check)   -- phone number(s)   -- description of your situation:  how you will afford to pay the rent, when you'd like to move in, what type of pets you have, how many people in your family, and at least two landlord references with phone numbers, along with your full names and dates of birth so I can run a brief background check.    If you've had criminal convictions or evictions, or do not have the income to pay the rent, you will not qualify.   We will get back to you within 24 hrs.

The bus stop is about 0.2 miles away, on the corner of 5th and Old Richardson.The route is the green line.  There is an application required. Our applications review 3 things : criminal history (no recent felonies); landlord history (people who have been evicted should not bother to apply) and a credit check like a bank does (no recent bankruptcies or court ordered collections or collections from other landlords). When applying we also require $50 earnest money (to hold the apartment 2 days while we process the application), so be sure to bring enough cash to cover this if you think you might be applying (sorry, we don't accept anything but cash for applications). If we turn you down for any reason the earnest money is returned. When you pass it is applied to (i.e. subtracted from) your first month's rent. (The only way you loose the earnest money is if you change your mind about renting the apartment.)
