The lease ends in August with options to renew with Management on your own terms. I moved into the apartment in September, but am MOVING TO CALIFORNIA for a new job! Ideally, I'd like to leave the apartment fully or partially furnished for the new tenant for a very reasonable price that we would negotiate. The building management, https://www.daroapartments.com, requires the potential tenant to complete and be approved through the Daro application process prior to taking occupancy.

Rent is $1960 with all utilities included. My internet is around $40 or so.   Efficient kitchen with lovely built-in cabinets in the adjoining dining area. Windows for the dining and living room look out unto the landscaped courtyard. The living room and bedroom are very spacious with large windows and hardwood floors. Bathroom has lovely checkered tile. Apartment boasts three large closets and utility hooks. The closet across from the bathroom has enough room to fit a dresser. The bathroom has plenty of storage and a deep soaking tub. The apartment has radiator heating. The kitchen has a four burner gas stove.   The lobby is gorgeous and the building has historic charm.

Offering culture and shopping, Georgetown attracts both locals and out-of-towners searching for good eats and best buys. For those who appreciate nature and outdoor activities, rent a kayak or paddleboard and enjoy the Potomac River up close. Or, stay on land and explore the many running trails. The White House is only eight minutes away with public transportation. Conveniently, Reagan National Airport is 30 minutes away with public transit, and Dulles International Airport is about 30 minutes by car.

The apartment is available after January 17 and we can be flexible on the move-in day!   Why the apartment rocks: Amazing location - 10 minute walk to the blue/orange/silver line at McPherson Square or the yellow/green line at Mt. Vernon Top-floor apartment - no upstairs neighbors Quiet building - We actually canât hear any neighbors or the city noises from this place Natural Light - lots of windows Pet Friendly - Incredibly pet-friendly building located near a number of great parks for dogs. The new renter would inherit our lower pet rent ($25 per month, instead of $50 per month) Amazing rooftop pool/grills - perfect for entertaining or being outside in the hot DC summer In-unit amenities - Washer/dryer, dishwasher, walk-in closet, oversized soaking tub and big kitchen Building amenities - 24-hour gym, 24-hour concierge/package service, a club room (with TVs, pool, foosball etc.), garage with guest parking available, and on-site maintenance  What this apartment costs:  $2594 per month in rent - about $150 cheaper than similarly sized apartments (on lower floors) in our building/neighborhood because we are long-term renters No security deposit If you have a pet, the building told me you would inherit our $25 per month pet-rent (normally $50) Utilities not included, vary by month, happy to share averages  The apartment might seem expensive on the surface, but we were able to save up enough money to buy a house in four years here because itâs only $1300 per person if you are a couple, we never had to pay for gym memberships, and we were both able to walk/bike to work. And people always want to come over, which saves money on going out!
