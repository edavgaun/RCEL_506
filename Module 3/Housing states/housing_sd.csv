The house is located in a good, nice, quiet neighborhood that is central to virtually everything!! Both the upstairs and the downstairs have their own bathrooms and the entire basement has been remodeled and updated recently.   I've had both m and f roomates and get along well with either. The current tenant is  30 and m, very quiet, clean, and courteous. I would expect the same of a prospective tenant as well.  A kitchenette area is available in the lower level as well. IE cupboards, countertop, mini fridge, cooktop, coffee maker, oven, and a microwave. Off-street parking, laundry, internet, cable, and ALL other utilities will be included in the $480 rent.  **** Deposit of $480, first months rent, last months rent, and a 6 month lease is required upon move in. ****  Absolutely NO pets and non-smokers are preferred, but an exception for the smoker can be made in the right circumstance. The room is available after a deposit, first/last months rent, is collected.  If you have any questions, go ahead and email me.... Also put ""room"" in subject box to weed out spam.",43.5167,-96.7474,sd

In the 1890's thru about the 1920's many of the wealthy families had servants, butlers and stable hands. The large house located at 405 West 2nd had the house at 115 N. Sanborn and 415 West 2nd for their servants or children. The building now known as 409 West 2nd was a stable or carriage house. The stable hand or butler would have lived in the upper level of this building with the horses and the carriage below. Once the age of automobiles was here these carriage houses were converted into garages or small houses many times they were called mother-in-law houses. . .because the mother-in-law would many times out live the father-in-law. . .and then the children would care for their mother-in-law until her passing. . .History lesson over.  409 West 2nd Avenue in Mitchell is a little difficult to find as it is only accessible from the alley from the west. This is the alley between 1st and 2nd Avenue on Edmunds street.  409 West 2nd is a two story tall carriage house with both bedrooms on the second floor with a center stair case leading up to them. Getting furniture up the stairs is not to hard as there is an outside door directly at the bottom of the staircase. . .however once you get the furniture up the stairs, getting it into the bedrooms is really difficult. The kitchen has a stove/refrigerator and washer/dryer furnished. Bath does have a tub with shower combination. I believe the new furnace has an AC unit on it but I really am not positive at this time.  Pets are accepted with a $350 pet deposit as well as an additional $25 per animal added to the monthly rent.  Our rental rates are based on a 12 month lease. If it is your intention to rent a unit for anything less than 12 months, the monthly rent will be increased by 20%.  Come-look-see. . .call Linda at  show contact info .  PS.

While I did not measure it, my guess is the apartment is 20 X 50. There are not many 1,000 sq ft one bedroom apartments in Mitchell.  Another Mitchell Landlord is advertising new construction, 720 sq ft for $700 with you paying the heat and electricity. Since their's is a multi-family building, you would have other tenants on both sides of you, on top of you, across the hall from you and underneath you, plus to get to your unreserved parking spot you have to walk down the hall, out the front door, down the sidewalk and across the parking lot.   This huge one bedroom has a reserved carport parking space within 20 feet of the private front door, plus we pay all utilities except your cable and internet. BUT WAIT THERE IS MORE! There is a double sound wall (walls 4' apart with only air in the middle) between you and the other two tenants in the building. This apartment should be quiet and it is remote, as your parking spot and front door are off the alley and not facing the busy street. Short one block walk to the theater and downtown coffee shops.           The painting was finished Friday...carpet and vinyl will be installed Monday and Tuesday. We set the toilet, bring in the appliances and you can move in on Wednesday. If you like the smell of fresh paint, carpet and vinyl, this is the apartment for you.
