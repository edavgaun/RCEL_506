Option to buy with-in lease term period is between 3.5% - 5% option fee down payment ($15,015 - $21,450).  .Property will be available April, 1, 2020, so secure your future home now.  100% of the Option Fee Down Payment counts towards the option price of the home later on when you go to exercise your option to purchase the house (so itâs NOT like an extra fee just to rent-to-ownâ¦ ALL of it counts towards the house), but it is always going to be much more than a typical security deposit for a straight rentalâ¦ Also, challenged credit OK for rent-to-own! We donât have a âcredit score requirementâ per se as in a specific #, but we do review your reports to make sure you have a clear game plan on what you need to do to get up to a 640 during the rental phase of the rent-to-own.
